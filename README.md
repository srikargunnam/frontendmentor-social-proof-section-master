## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS & Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I generally prefer to use _position: absolute and top, bottom properties_ to center the main div, but this project helped me understand that even _flex_ can be better used to do the same process in a better way, but it really depends on the perspective of the user.

### Continued development

I would try to implement those techniques which i felt could replace what i used earlier for similar purpose.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the best place where you can understand the usage of CSS properties very well, i found this as a very helpful resourse
- [1 Line Layouts](https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/) - This is an amazing website, where you can find the 10 Modern CSS layout and sizing techniques.
